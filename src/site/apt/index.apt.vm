Open Archive

 Open Archive is a {{{http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html}XEP-0136}} complient server side message
 archive for the {{{http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/}Openfire}} XMPP server.

 Currently it supports automated message archiving and message retrieval through XEP-0136 compliant Jabber clients
 and a web UI for the administrator. Support for manual archiving and preferences is planned for future releases.

 Open Archive requires either {{{http://www.mysql.com/}MySQL}} or the embedded {{{http://www.hsqldb.org/}HSQLDB}},
 support for other databases might be added at a later point.

 To install the plugin just rename it to <<<archive.jar>>>, place it into the plugins folder of your Openfire
 server and enable it in the Openfire console at Server Settings/Archive Settings.
